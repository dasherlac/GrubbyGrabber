## Synopsis:
Player has to perform an emergency landing on an alien planet, that is made of giant islands emerging from the abyss.  
The player will be aided by insect-like creatures to fulfill their goal. 





## Gamestyle:
 - Meta (View, graphics, etc.): 3D third person, free camera(?),  
 - Art direction : Similar to Harvest Moon on GameCube -> Stylised, cute, simplistic, put detail into characters, textures, avoid crypt rat and WoW prairie dog.
 - Player character concept : Maybe some spacesuit (SUS) guy in helmet, with basic custumisation - Suit style, colour, sex, shoulder/waist width, muscle-fat distribution, (height should be standard I think)

## Story idea:
You are an interstellar zoologist, who is tasked with investigating designated planets. Due to management not investing enough resources into your mission, you need to make a pitstop at an uncharted plane, because of lack of supplies. You land, hoping you can refill your inventory. But as you began to investigate, you notice that the planet harbors the type of life the management would be interested in. You decide to stay and continue your assignment on this planet instead, and use the limited supplies you have in your spaceship. You need resources and a base, as soon as possible, so you can start the work.

## Game mechanics:
### Gameplay loop:
 - Start: Map generation, everything is accessible but soft-locks may be present. Game takes place on an island floating in the abyss- stepping off the cliff will "kill" the player by teleporting them back to where they fell from, on low HP. Player will be guided to the first egg by hints - for instance following a silk tread into the forest. Eggs hatch on their own, altough takes time for now. Player spawns around the spaceship /a structure-object, not accessible area/ with minimal resources enough for survival. Area around Spaceship is a safe zone, where no enemies spawn. You can constantly increase the radius, area size/upgrade etc. Technology tree = spaceship has crafting stations, incubators, etc. with upgrades. You can encapsulate this base into your inventory to take it and fly to other islands, if you manage to get some fuel.
 
 - Midgame: The world can be foraged for basic supplies, but mainly to feed the grubs. However, the player receives the most valuable crafting materials from the grubbies, that can be used to upgrade equipment and/or the player. These can not be gained from elsewhere, to motivate the player to keep hatching, raising and collecting stuff from the insects they encounter. Rudimentary crafting stations become available and ready for upgrade to aid the player. The first island where the player spawns is constant and remains so during the entirety of the game. The other islands generate when the player manages to land on them, but despawn if the player leaves them without building a structure there. Over the course of the game, the player will receive hints that it's encouraged visit to other islands, to gain more/better/newer resources.
 - EndGame: The fuel is very important: goal of the game is to bank enough fuel to fly home with the spaceship, thus unlocking the ending. **TODO**
 - New game+?:**TODO**

### Insect growth:

When the egg hatches, a grub will emerge, and its class will be determined by the type of the egg.

They will have 6 attributes, which can be trained/improved with inputs by the player, including but not exlusively : Interaction between player and insect, food, items, interactions between the other insects, environment, etc. 
Attributes will contribute to the creature's appearance: Look will be determined by how well each of these attributes are developed. The grubs will begin to change their appearance depending of how much points the player has invested in each of the stats. For instance, stamina could be responsible to its overall size: if stamina level is higher, the creature grows in size. Mandibles grow exponentially larger by invested points, intelligence grows antennae, etc. based on this chart.


Stat name|Physical characteristic|Buggy name
---------|-----------------------|----------
Stamina/Constitution|size|RESILIENCE
Attack|pincers, mandibles |AGGRESSION
Defense|chithin exoskeleton, thickness|ARMOR
Dexterity/fly|wings|NIMBLENESS
Speed/movement|grasshopper leg|SWIFTNESS
Int/wis|antennae|PERCEPTION

Each individual class has attributes, that are easier to improve in their case, attribues that are boosted/prone to. Nightbug would excel at flight+intelligence,  Tankbug excels at defense+stamina, Fightbug excels at speed+attack, but nothing would rule out anything, this would merely make raising the insects faster in those stats. E.g. It's possible to increase Nightbug's speed and attack, but the proccess would be slower.

### Equipment progression:
**Vision** : Combat should stay somewhat stagnant, as in imporovements will never make fights trivial, rather they should instead cut foraging/hunting time short, by rewarding better/more resources. The incentive should not be combat oriented, it should focus on passive attributes : collect/foraging more and faster, move faster, more information about enemies, lore. Combat improvements should be minimalized (however try to make it rewarding if possible).	Try to guide the player into a direction, where knowledge and information is why you are able to make your place in the game world, rather than strength and stats
### Combat:
Something akin to WildStar, where attacks are just areas described mathematically, instead of hitboxes and such. The attacks take up a place in their designated areas, assigned to an enemy, the player is encouraged to dodge/avoid them instea of taking the hits. The attacks can occur semi-randomly with a decision tree (state machine/pseudo-AI).
